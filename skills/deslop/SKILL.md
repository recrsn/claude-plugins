Check the diff against origin/main, and remove all unnecessary changes
introduced in this branch. Run `git fetch origin` to make sure git context is
up-to-date.

Here is the list of files changed in this branch:
!`git diff --stat origin/main`

**Focus on removing unnecessary ADDITIONS, not reverting improvements:**

## Things to remove

- Comments that merely describe obvious operations ("Fetch product settings" for
	a fetch call)
- Comments that narrate code flow ("Update review state with product settings")
- Extra defensive checks or try-catch blocks abnormal for that codebase area (
	especially if called by trusted/validated codepaths)
- Casts to any to get around type issues
- Unnecessary implementation details in docstrings
- Commented-out code (e.g., // this.model = config.model)
- Any other style inconsistent with the file
- Verbose logging or debug statements that are not needed for normal operation

## Things to keep

- Anything not included in the "diff", even if it matches the above criteria,
	since it is not an addition in this branch
- Code simplifications
- Refactoring
- Removing redundant code/comments from main
- Docstrings on exported functions/classes including @param, @return, @throws
	etc
